## 🧼 Code Style Guidelines

* Use **ES6+ syntax**
* Use consistent formatting (`Prettier` if configured)
* Keep functions small and well-named
* Add comments where logic is not obvious
* Place new algorithms in the `src/algorithms/` folder

---

## ✍️ Commit Message Format

Please follow this convention for clear and consistent Git history:

```
type(scope): short description

body (optional, use for explanation or issue references)
```

### Common types:

* `feat` → New feature
* `fix` → Bug fix
* `docs` → Documentation only changes
* `style` → Formatting only (white-space, commas, etc.)
* `refactor` → Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
* `test` → Adding or updating tests

### Examples:

```
feat(sort): add insertion sort algorithm
fix(bubbleSort): fix incorrect loop condition
docs(readme): add usage section
refactor(arrayGen): simplify array generation logic
```
